            <h2>SN.01: Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
              Season 1 begins with the aftermath of a plane crash, which leaves
              the surviving passengers of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 on what
              seems to be an uninhabited tropical island. Jack Shephard, a
              spinal surgeon, becomes their leader.
              <br />
              Their survival is threatened by a number of mysterious entities,
              including polar bears, an unseen creature that roams the jungle
              (the "Smoke Monster"), and the island's malevolent inhabitants
              known as "The Others". They encounter a French woman named
              Danielle Rousseau, who was shipwrecked on the island 16 years
              before the main story and is desperate for news of her daughter,
              Alex.
              <br />
              They also find a mysterious metal hatch buried in the ground.
              While two survivors, Locke and Boone, try to force the hatch open,
              four others, Michael, Jin, Walt, and Sawyer attempt to leave on a
              raft that they have built. Meanwhile, flashbacks center on details
              of the individual survivors' lives prior to the plane crash.
