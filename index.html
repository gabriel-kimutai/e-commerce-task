            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
              Season 1 begins with the aftermath of a plane crash, which leaves
              the surviving passengers of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 on what
              seems to be an uninhabited tropical island. Jack Shephard, a
              spinal surgeon, becomes their leader. Their survival is threatened
              by a number of mysterious entities, including polar bears, an
              unseen creature that roams the jungle (the "Smoke Monster"), and
              the island's malevolent inhabitants known as "The Others". They
              encounter a French woman named Danielle Rousseau, who was
              shipwrecked on the island 16 years before the main story and is
              desperate for news of her daughter, Alex. They also find a
              mysterious metal hatch buried in the ground. While two survivors,
              Locke and Boone, try to force the hatch open, four others,
              Michael, Jin, Walt, and Sawyer attempt to leave on a raft that
              they have built. Meanwhile, flashbacks center on details of the
              individual survivors' lives prior to the plane crash.
