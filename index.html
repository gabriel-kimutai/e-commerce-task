          <p>
            The series begins with the aftermath of a plane crash on a remote,
            mysterious island in the Pacific Ocean. The survivors, a diverse
            group of passengers and crew members, find themselves stranded on
            this seemingly uninhabited island with no means of communication
            with the outside world. As they struggle to adapt to their new
            environment, they encounter a series of bizarre and inexplicable
            events, including a polar bear in the jungle, a hidden hatch, and
            encounters with a group of hostile "Others" living on the island.

            Desmond gathers many of the islanders at the benefit concert of
            Daniel Widmore (Jeremy Davies) and Drive Shaft. One by one, each
            protagonist begins to recognize one another based on close contact
            with a person or object that was important to them throughout their
            time on the island, receiving flashes of memory. Eventually, most of
            them remember their past lives and are drawn to the church that was
            to be the site of Jack's father's funeral.
