            <p>
              Desmond gathers many of the islanders at the benefit concert of
              Daniel Widmore (Jeremy Davies) and Drive Shaft. One by one, each
              protagonist begins to recognize one another based on close contact
              with a person or object that was important to them throughout
              their time on the island, receiving flashes of memory. Eventually,
              most of them remember their past lives and are drawn to the church
              that was to be the site of Jack's father's funeral.
